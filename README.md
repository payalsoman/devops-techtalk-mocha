## High Level Project Report
**What is Mocha?**

- Mocha is the feature-rich Javascript testing framework running on Node.js.
- Relatively new. First stable build released in 2012.
- Simple to setup and is highly extensible.
   (Node Debugger, Reporters etc..)
- Supports assertion libraries like Chai, expect.js and should.js.
- Comparable to Jasmine and QUnit.

**Features**

| Feature        | Description    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Support for multiple assertion libraries |	Mocha supports asserion libraries like Chai,expect.js,should.js , better.js |
| Simple async support, including promises |	Testing asynchronous code with Mocha is quite simpler using done method callback |
| File watcher support |	Mocha can detects changes to the files and can trigger test suit execution.  |
| test-specific timeouts |	Mocha cane provision for suite-level Timeouts (may be applied to entire test "suites") as well as Test-specific timeouts. |
| string diff support |	It can display the difference between what was expected, and what the assertion actually saw. |
| Optionally run tests that match a regexp |	Using --grep option mocha can trigger only run tests matching the given pattern. |
| node debugger support |	Mocha allows integration with node debugging tools like node-inspector. |


**Limitations**

- It has limited support as compared to Jasmine and qUnit.
- It runs tests sequentially.
- Because mocha provides flexibility, it requires additional analysis to determine which tools to integrate, hence consuming time.


## Setup Instructions
* Clone this repo, run `npm install`.
* Install redis and run on localhost:6379
* To test the sample test case redistest.js we need to run application server, `node main.js`

### Running Tests using Mocha
* Run the tests using , `mocha`
* This will execute all the sample test cases in Test directory.
